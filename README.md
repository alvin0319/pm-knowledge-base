## Why PocketMine?

PocketMine is well-known server software which has ultimate features for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition written in PHP.

You can modify server software's behavior by using plugins or PHP extensions.

Now, the maintainer of PocketMine-MP is [dktapps(dylan)](https://github.com/dktapps), before was [Shoghi](https://github.com/shoghicp)

so, even though it is written in PHP, I suggest you to use PocketMine instead of other softwares like Cloudburst Nukkit, MiNET and BDS(includes BDSX) if you are **NOT** looking for Vanilla server.

PocketMine is written in PHP, which is easy to use and learn, so no need to compile source.
