## Why PocketMine?

PocketMine is well-known server software which has ultimate features for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition written in PHP.

You can modify server software's behavior by using plugins or PHP extensions.

Now, the maintainer of PocketMine-MP is [dktapps(dylan)](https://github.com/dktapps), before was [Shoghi](https://github.com/shoghicp)

PocketMine is written in PHP, which is easy to use and learn, so no need to compile source.

I know PHP is suck at backend especially Server software, but PHP also has its benefit and now it is becoming more modern programming language.

so, even though it is written in PHP, I suggest you to use PocketMine instead of other softwares like Cloudburst Nukkit, MiNET and BDS (including BDSX) if you are **NOT** looking for Vanilla server.
